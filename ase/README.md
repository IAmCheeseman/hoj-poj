### Lua Aseprite Loader
A lightweight library for reading Aseprite files in Lua. No need to parse the Aseprite file into a JSON format - this library allows you to access the data directly.

We recommend using this library in conjunction with an [atlas builder](https://github.com/elloramir/packer) to create sprite sheets.

### Example
Check out the example folder in the root directory of the project to see how to use this library in your project.

Here is a preview of the tags in the player.ase file:

Have fun :smile:

### Loader Output
The output of this library is similar to the format specified in the Aseprite file [specs](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/docs/ase-file-specs.md) with a few modifications
